I had a great experience making, drinking, and sharing my first batch of ginger beer. It was simple to make, tasty, and fun to share. So I decided to make another batch.

This time I wanted to do one better by using a “ginger bug” (which I need to grow from scratch) instead of using active dry yeast I did in my first batch. The ginger bug will contain the natural yeasts that will take care of fermentation. Once the ginger bug is ready, I will proceed to brewing the ginger beer like in my first batch. Fun fact: the ginger bug also contains probiotics! 

In this post, I’ll describe my experiment of trying to make ginger beer using a ginger bug. It took me three batch attempts to get it right. At one point, I almost gave up and was going to just use active dry yeast again.

##### Growing the Ginger Bug

1. Chop up a small piece of ginger (about size of a large egg). Keep the peel on as it contains the naturally occurring yeast.
2. Mix in the the chopped ginger and 2 tablespoons of white sugar into 2 cups of filtered water in a glass jar. Cover the jar with a paper towel so dirty flies and skin dust don’t float in. Store the jar in a dark and room temperature area like a kitchen cupboard. That’s it! Now you just have to feed it for a couple days until you see bubbles and fizzing in the concoction.
3. Feed your ginger bug every 24 hours by mixing in the same amount of chopped ginger and sugar. For me, bubbles would start appearing on the third day. That means the yeast is active and feeding on the sugar. I usually feed it an additional day so on day 4 you’re ready to use it and make your ginger beer.

##### First Attempt - I Cheated

In my first attempt, I was hoping to use the ginger bug on day 5. I kept the ginger bug going for 7 days though due to life delaying my purchase of the ingredients. The bug was fizzy and had a strong smell by day 7. Smelled a bit sour too. Upon some research I found that the sour smell is the acid produced when bacteria consumes the sugar in your ginger bug. That’s the probiotic bacteria.

I made a few improvements to my brewing process this time. I cut up the ginger and blended it in a blender—a safer and more efficient way to get all the good juices. I might have gone too far with the efficiency of blending though as I also blended 2 whole lemons, including the peel. 

Next, I proceeded to to mix the 2 cups of white sugar, blended ginger, and blended lemon together in a boiling pot of water. I boiled that for a few minutes and then cool down the pot of ginger brew. Here’s my next pro-tip: instead of leaving the pot to cool to room temperature over many hours, placed the pot in the sink filled with cold water. It cooled to room temperature in less than 30 minutes. 

Once the ginger brew cooled to room temperature, I strained the brew into my plastic pop bottles for fermentation. Here is when I also added in about 1 cup of strained ginger bug into each 2 litre pop bottles. Cap it and shake the bottle to mix it all together. Store it in a dark and room temperature place. 

From what I read online, this is where I let the brew ferment for about 3 days. On day 3 I unscrewed the caps to let out some of the gas—there was no gas or pressure at all. It was disappointing.

I wanted to save it! So I added more ginger bug into the bottles. The next day, still not carbonation. Very sad. I didn’t want all that ginger to go to waste so I added some active dry yeast into the bottles. That did the job. There was pressure and carbonation the next day. But I was a bit upset that I had ‘cheated’ in a way.

I let the brew ferment for another day or two and then refrigerated it and brought this batch to a Friday evening party with friends. People liked it! I liked it too, but I wasn’t as happy with the flavour this time. I think the lemon peels was a bit too strong and added an unnecessary bitterness.

##### Second Attempt - Disappointing

For my second attempt, I made some changes. I read online that you should not peel the ginger used for making the ginger bug. That’s because of the natural yeast that’s already on it. In hindsight, I realized that was probably not the reason my first attempt didn’t work because the ginger bug in my first attempt was bubbling lively. So it likely wasn’t the ginger bug. 

The other change I made this time was not blending the lemons with the peel. I just used squeezed juice.

The last change I made was I bottled the ginger beer in glass swing-top bottles instead of the plastic pop bottles. The swing-top bottles I bought were meant to hold carbonated drinks so the glass can withstand the pressure. Make sure that’s the case for you too if you want to bottle with glass bottles because they’d likely explode if not.

The rest of the process remained the same so I’ll skip to day 3 when I uncapped the bottles to release some gas. No release of pressured gas. Just like the first attempt. I was pretty bummed.

I ended up just dumping it all and didn’t try to revive it.

##### Third Attempt - Maybe This Will Work?

After my second attempt, I took a break from ginger beer for a couple weeks. I also thought to myself if I should just make it using active dry yeast instead of a ginger bug. I thought this because I wanted to make the ginger beer because it tastes good and it was a joy to share with friends. It wasn’t the probiotics (that you get when using a ginger bug) that I cared about. 

I told this to my friend Patrick and he convinced me I should again. He has been having pretty good success with his kombucha brewing. I read more online about why a ginger brew might not carbonate and found one response that I wanted to try for my third attempt. Instead of bottling the brew immediately after mixing the ginger bug in, I would mix the brew and bug together and let it sit uncapped for about 12 hours before capping them. The idea is it would allow the yeast to settle-in after the shock of being mixed into another concoction because having oxygen capped out. 

So, after cooling the ginger brew to room temperature, I mixed about 80% of the ginger bug and the ginger brew into a glass jug. I covered the top with a paper towel and let it sit for about 12 hours.
