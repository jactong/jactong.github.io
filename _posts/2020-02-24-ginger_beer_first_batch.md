I never thought I’d order a non-alcoholic drink at a restaurant, let alone at the Super Bowl. 99% of the time it’s beer or water. 

<br/>

After drinking heavily a couple days straight prior to the Super Bowl, I wasn’t — and neither was my stomach — feeling like having more beer. But come on, it was the Super Bowl and I was watching it at a restaurant pub (Boston Pizza) with a friend. So I ordered a pint. 

<br/>

With determination to only have one beer, I sipped that pint till half-time. When it came time to order another drink, I begrudgingly considered the non-alcoholic drinks. Pop, juice, cocktails, absolutely not. I don’t enjoy very sweet drinks. Ginger Beer for $3.99 caught my eye under the non-alcoholic section. I ordered one! I recall it had a cool name, sort of like what a craft brewery could be called. I’ve never drank ginger beer before that day. Though I later learned that ginger beer is in Moscow Mules, but I didn’t know that then. 

<br/>

The ginger beer arrived in a fancy 375 ml glass bottle. My eyes lit up after the first drink. Cold, fizzy, and delicious. There was a strong but not overpowering taste of ginger and it wasn’t too sweet. I loved it and exclaimed my surprise to my friend Patrick. He took a sip to try it and he too was pleasantly impressed. Patrick, who had been talking about brewing his own kombucha, remembered that ginger beer is actually fairly easy to brew at home. He told me that. Our eyes lit up. Ideas went rampant. Patrick could brew kombucha. I could brew ginger beer. We could open a fermentation cafe or something.

<br/>

Anyhow, a couple weeks later, I took action and bought the few ingredients needed to get started. 

<br/>

**This is how it went**

##### Step 1 --- Ingredients and Equipment

Bought a few items I didn’t already have. Here’s a full list of what’s needed following [this article's](https://www.theroastedroot.net/how-to-make-ginger-beer/) instructions with some slight alterations:

<br/>

**Ingredients:**
* Ginger root (1/3 cup peeled and grated)

* Squeezed lemon juice (1/3 cup) --- one full lemon was enough for me

* Granulated sugar (1 cup) --- I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar and 2/3 cup of white sugar

* Active dry yeast (1 teaspoon)

* Cream of tartar (1/2 teaspoon)

* Spring water / filtered water (9 cups) --- I bought a 12 pack of bottled water. Wasteful I know.

**Equipment:**
* A 2 litre plastic bottle --- I bought a 2 litre bottle of sparkling water. It’s easier to rinse. You must use a plastic bottle because this is the container you’ll use to ferment the ginger beer, during which time a lot of carbonation is produced. A glass bottle would explode from what I’ve read.

* A pot that you can use to boil at least 2 litres of water and mixing the ingredients

* A funnel for easier transferring of the ginger beer between containers

* Grater to grate the ginger root

* A citrus juicer for easier juicing of the lemon

* A fine strainer to strain the pulp when transferring into the bottle for fermentation

* Bottles to store your 2 litre worth of ginger beer. --- I used a 1 litre beer growler and I bought 4 x 275 ml (9.3 fl oz) glass bottles of ginger beer from the store and used the emptied bottles for the remaining 1 litre. I’m thinking if I continue making ginger beer, I’d like to buy a nice set of glass swing top bottles about 350 ml (12 oz) capacity because I’ve found that’s a perfect serving size for myself.

##### Step 2 --- Brewing

1. Peel and grate 1/3 cup worth of ginger root.
2. Squeeze 1/3 cup of lemon juice.
3. Bring 4 cups of spring water to boil in a pot.
4. Add the grated ginger root, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar in the boiling water.
5. Turn the stove off and mix in 1 cup of granulated sugar until it’s dissolved.
6. Add in the remaining 5 cups of spring water into the pot and let it cool down to room temperature (23 degree C / 75 degree F). In hindsight I would have placed the remaining cups of spring water in the fridge earlier on to speed up the cooling process.

7. Once your pot of ingredients is at room temperature, mix in 1 teaspoon of active dry yeast. 
8. Cover the pot with clean towel so it can still breathe but prevents anything from contaminating it. I just used a few sheets of kitchen paper towels.
9. Move the pot to a dark and room temperature location and leave for 3 hours.

##### Step 3 --- Fermentation

{:start="10"}

10. After 3 hours, pour the brew into the cleaned 2 litre plastic bottle and leave a bit of air space for the carbonation. So I made a slight detour from the blog’s instructions I was following here. The blog instructs to leave the concoction in the pot for 3 hours and then bottle it to ferment. At the beginning of this step, it was a work day and already 10 pm. 3 hours alter would be 1 am and I was already a bit sleep deprived from social activities that week. So I decided to just leave it overnight and bottle it in the morning. I didn’t think it would be a big deal. I ended up transferring the brew from the pot to the bottles in the morning after 10 hours. Later at work that day I had a concerning realization that since I left the brew with freshly added yeast in the metal pot for so long, that might have killed or prevented growth of the yeast. I came to peace with it that the fermentation might not work and I would try it again. I would soon figure out if it had worked or not I realized. If the bottle had gas build up when I loosen the cap that evening, then that would mean the yeast survived and the fermentation is in progress. Later that evening, I loosened the bottle cap with the sweet sound of carbonation. Success! Also, notice the sediments at the bottle of the bottles in the second last image below. That’s another sign of the fermentation working. If I’m correct, that’s the by-product—along with CO2—the yeast produces after consuming the sugar in the brew.
11. Place the bottles in a dark room temperature place for 2 to 3 days. The longer you leave it the drier and less sweet your ginger beer will taste. I fermented mine for 3 days. 
12. Twice a day, loosen the bottle cap a bit to let out some of the gas.

    <p style='width:90%;padding-left: 10%; font-size: 10pt; text-align: left'>The 2 litre fermentation bottling and a bit extra in a smaller water bottle.</p>
    
13. After the 2 or 3 days of fermentation you decided on, move the bottle into the refrigerator to chill it for drinking and to slow the fermentation. The fermentation will continue if you leave it out in room temperature. I wanted to store my ginger beer in a glass swing-top growler bottle so I transferred the brew there before refrigerating. 

##### Step 4 --- Drink and Enjoy!

{:start="14"}

14. Once chilled, it’s ready to share and drink! You can store it for about 10 days. I shared almost all of my first batch with family, friends, and colleagues. Telling them the process and seeing them enjoy the ginger beer was the most rewarding part.

##### Feedback and Analysis

My friends and coworkers who tried my first batch liked it and described it as light and refreshing. A couple people said it’d be a perfect summer patio non-alcoholic drink. 

<br/>

I also agree with the reception. I can taste the ginger but it’s rather light. It’s also not too sweet and is a bit dry—which is exactly how I wanted it. Carbonation was lower than preferred, which I assume is because I let out too much gas when I let loosened the bottles each day during the fermentation process. 

<br/>

**For my next batch, I’ve decided to test the following changes:**

* Refrigerate 5 cups of water for a quicker cooling down duration. 
* Add more ginger for a stronger ginger flavouring. 
* Add more lemon juice to increase the citrus flavour.
* Release less gas when loosening the bottles during the fermentation stage for increased carbonation.
* I might try just using boiled tap water instead of having to buy bottled water. Tap water in Vancouver is one of the best in the world anyways.
* Grow my own “ginger bug” from scratch instead of using yeast
